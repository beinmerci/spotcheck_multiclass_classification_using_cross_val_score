# spot check on multiclass classification algorithms using scoring parameter(cross_val_score with metric as accuracy)

Data: MNIST Data https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data

Problem Type : Identify which algorithms are best suited for current dataset for multiclass classification

Evaluation Method used: Scoring paramete(model_selection.cross_val_score)                                                                   
Model selection and evaluation using tools, such as model_selection.GridSearchCV and model_selection.cross_val_score, take a scoring parameter that controls what metric they apply to the estimators evaluated.
